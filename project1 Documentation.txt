Analyse each and every column What all datas are there
And a filter so that we can find what all values there in each column
In date column the data are not in proper format so we have to convert into proper date So i changed all the date column into date format using power query
Start time is in correct time format so we no need to change anything
Day of the week also contains only week days and no empty spaces
Going to column also have 2 data GSK or home
In Distance, MaxSpeed, AvgSpeed, AvgMovingSpeed column we have to check any outliers are present using box and whisker plot 
	from the observation we have few outliers in each column soo in practicality they may occur
In Fuel economy column we have some unwanted and blank spaces we have to clear it bu filling the values
	For that we can divide the distance withthe fuel economy so that we get a value 
	That value is the factor difference between distance and fuel economy
	After that i found the average of it it is almost 5.33 
	so im multiplying the empty or the - cells with this value
In total time and moving time there is no empty space or special characters
After cleaning the data i went to the tableau

In tableau i created many comparision with day of week its is found that in tues he is travelling more
